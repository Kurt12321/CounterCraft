	§f§lDETAILED TWEAKS AND IMPROVEMENTS
	
	
	
	§c§lGAME HEALTH
	
	
	§f§lIntroducing New Smoke Grenade And Bolt Animation 
	§f§l        Dual Perspective Replication 
	
	§fSmoke grenades and Capitaos smoke darts have been fully
	§frevamped. They are now completely opaque and will be
	§fdisplayed the exact same way on every client, which will
	§fmake them much more reliable and consistent. We lowered
	§fthe amount of smoke grenades to 2 per operator. This
	§fchange will also temporarily make Capitao's smokes grey,
	§finstead of blue.
	
	§f§lNEW GAME DESIGN UPDATE ON ACOGS FOR DEFENDERS
	
	§fAs a standard from now on there will not be a 2 or 3
	§fspeed Defender with the option of using the ACOG sight.
	
	§fWhile we like the fact that defenders can challenge
	§fattackers on long distances on their approach, we
	§fbelieve this strategy should come with a higher risk.
	§fThe possibility for 3 speeds operators like Jager and
	§fBandit to challenge on the longest distances while 
	§fbeing able to relocate very quickly is currently too
	§fstrong. As a consequence, Jager and Bandit lose their
	§fACOG, and the only new defenders that will get ACOGS
	§fwill be the heavy armored ones. However, this does not
	§fmean all heavy armor operators will have ACOGS and
	§fwill be decided on by the Game Design team.
	
	§f§lTWO DRONES DEPLOYED AT A TIME FOR ATTATCKERS
	
	§fAttackers can now deploy a second drone without
	§fdestroying the first one. This works just like Twitch
	§fwho can already deploy her two shock drones. The
	§fmechanics are also the same where launching a new drone
	§fwill place the attacker in the new drone’s camera, and
	§fthey can re-access their first drone view by scrolling
	§fthe observation tool list.
	
	§fWe hope that this change will reinforce the importance
	§fof the preparation phase by making it possible to position
	§fa drone inside the building, and then deploy a new drone
	§fduring the action phase to scout ahead without losing
	§fthis first drone.
	
	§fWe will monitor closely the impact this will have on
	§fglobal win rates of attackers and defenders, as we
	§fexpect this to give an additional edge to attackers
	§fsince they can now have up to 10 active cameras at
	§fa time.
	
	§f§lKANAL SPAWN KILL EXPLOIT
	
	§fUsing the shield vault exploit, Defenders can place
	§fthemselves on the windowsill of North windows of
	§fControl Room aiming at Floating Dock spawn location,
	§fand North windows of Server Room aiming at Construction
	§fSite. We have fixed this so defenders can no longer use
	§fthis spawn kill exploit.
	
	
	
	§c§lPLAYER COMFORT
	
	
	§f§lDEFENDER VISION FILTER IS REMOVED WHEN GOING OUTSIDE
	
	§fWe have removed the red filter that make defenders’
	§fvision uncomfortable when they run outside the
	§fbuilding. We think the red warning in the middle
	§fof the screen should be clear enough feedback that
	§fyou are doing something dangerous.
	
	§f§lPRIORITY ON OBSERVATION TOOLS FOR ALIVE PLAYERS
	
	§fIf an alive player browses the observation tool list, 
	§fhe will now have priority over dead players for camera
	§fcontrols (in attack and defense). While this should
	§fnot make much of a difference in organized matches,
	§fwe think it should help in public matchmaking in case
	§fa dead player is AFK while controlling a camera and
	§fprevents alive players from getting info.
